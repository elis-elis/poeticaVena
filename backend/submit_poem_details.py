    Handle logic for collaborative poem submissions.
    This function performs a series of validation steps before saving the poem.
        - Calls validate_max_lines() from poem_val.py.
        - Calls validate_consecutive_contributions() to ensure the same poet isn‚Äôt contributing consecutively.
        - Fetching the poem type criteria (e.g., max lines, rhyme scheme) from the database.
        The criteria must be present and valid; otherwise, the process stops.
        - Calls validate_poem_content() from poem_val.py.
        The previous lines are passed along with the current contribution for types 
        like Haiku and Nonet that require full-context validation.
    If all validation passes, the contribution is saved.
    It checks if the poem is complete and marks it as published if the maximum number of lines is reached.
